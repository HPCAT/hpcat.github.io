      <description>Professor Ahmed Louri and his graduate student (P. Roychowdhury) have published a conference paper that explores reconfigurable, all-photonic inter-rack interconnects for data-centers. The paper titled &amp;ldquo;Reconfigurable All-Photonic Inter-Rack Interconnect for Data-Centers,” will appear in Proceedings of Frontiers in Optics 2017 (FIO), Sept. 18-21, 2017, Washington, D.C. FIO emcompasses the breadth of optical science and provides an atmosphere that fosters the exchange of information between those working in fundamental research and those looking for solutions to engineering problems.</description>
