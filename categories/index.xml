      <description>The project is a three-year collaborative effort with Dr. Fabrizio Lombardi (Northeastern University). The total amount of funding is $487,000, and GW’s portion is $262,000. In this research, Dr. Louri and his team seek to investigate and improve the advances and unique advantages of approximate computing to develop systems in both hardware and software (algorithms) that are low-power, high performance, and error-configurable. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop computing systems that are capable of adjusting performance by exploiting relationships between hardware and software for different applications such as cognitive processing, digital signal/image processing, big data, and scientific processing.</description>
