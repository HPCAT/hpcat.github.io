Dr. Ahmed Louri is the David and Marilyn Karlgaard Professor of ECE and the Director of <a href="http://www2.engr.arizona.edu/~hpcat/" target="new"> High Performance Computing Architectures and Technologies</a> in the <a href="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/" target="new">School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> at <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/" target="new">The George Washington University (GWU)</a>. Dr. Ahmed Louri received the M.S and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles in 1984 and 1988 respectively. Prior to joining GWU in August 2015, he was a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Arizona from 1988 to 2015. Dr. Louri was the Chair of the Computer Engineering Program of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Arizona from 2000 to 2006. <br> <br>

From 2010 to 2013, he served as a Program Director in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) of the National Science Foundation with an annual research portfolio of $800 million. He managed the core computer architecture program and was on the management team of several cross-cutting programs including cyber-physical systems (CPS), Expeditions in Computing (EIC), Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI), Trustworthy Computing (SaTC), and Failure-Resistant Systems (FRS). <br> <br>

He previously held visiting scientist positions at the University of Electro-Communications (UEC) (Chofu, Japan), Communications Research Laboratory (Tokyo, Japan), Laboratoire d'Informatique du Parallelism (LIP) (Lyon, France), University of Tsukuba (Tsukuba, Japan), Universite de Paul Sabatier (Toulouse, France), and the National Center for Scientific Research (Centre Nationale de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)) Toulouse, France. <br> <br>

Dr. Louri's research is in the broad area of  computer architecture and  parallel computing  with particular emphasis on interconnection networks, optical interconnects for parallel computing systems, reconfigurable computing systems, scalable and power-efficient architectures, Network on chips (NoCs) for multi-core and many-core architectures, fault-tolerant and self-healing NoCs, emerging interconnect technologies (photonic, wireless, RF, hybrid) for multi-core architectures and Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs), embedded systems, cognitive computing  and machine-learning enabled  computing and networking. He has published more than 130 journal articles and peer-reviewed conference papers in these areas, and holds several US and international patents. His research has been sponsored by NSF, DOE, AFOSR, and a number of industrial organizations. <br> <br>

Dr. Louri is a Fellow of IEEE, a member of the IEEE Society Technical Committee on Computer Architecture, a member of the IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing, and a member of IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Microprocessors and Microcomputers. <br> <br>

Dr. Louri is the recipient of the National Science Foundation Research Initiation Award (1989), the Best article Award from IEEE Micro, the Advanced Telecommunications Organization of Japan Fellowship, the Centre Nationale de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), France, Fellowship, and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowship, and several teaching awards. Dr. Louri was instrumental in bringing optical interconnects into mainstream research in interconnection networks and bridging the gap between computer architecture and optics research communities. He served as a General Chair for the 13th Annual Symposium of the High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA-13), Phoenix, Arizona, 2007, the general Co-Chair of the Second Workshop on Optics in Communications and Computer Sciences (WOCCS-99), Toulouse France, 1999, and the General Chair for the Workshop on Optics in High-Performance Computing Systems, Lyon France 1996. He has served and continues to serve on the executive and technical program committees of numerous international conferences including, Optical Society of America, meetings on Optics in Computing, the IEEE/OSA conference on Massively Parallel Processing using Optical Interconnects (MPPOI), the IEEE Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA),  the International Parallel & Distributed processing Symposium (IPDPS), the International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing and Systems (PDCS), the International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP), the ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communication Systems (ANCS), the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (IEEE Micro), the International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT), the ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (NOCS), among several others. He has served on the panels of several funding agencies, and is often invited as Keynote Speaker at various conferences.  He has served as guest editor for Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (JPDC), and is currently serving as an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Computers, the IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, and the IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing.  Dr. Louri frequently consults in for companies in the computer architecture and parallel computing areas. <br> <br>
