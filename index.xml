      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Step 1. Install Hugo Goto hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your os and architecture.
Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at installing hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:
 Clone the hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313  Corresponding pseudo commands:</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning for High Performance, Energy-Efficient and Reliable NoCs   With continued aggressive technology scaling, Network-on- Chips (NoCs) architectures are facing three major challenges including minimizing power consumption, scaling performance and providing a reliable and robust communication limited by area, power, and cost constraints. Researchers have proposed various techniques individually tackling these challenges, while few efforts to date have simultaneously targeted improving power, performance and reliability together. Due to the complexity of the interactions among three competing objectives and explosion of design space, it is harder to manually design rules and strategies for interconnection system for optimizing power, reliability and performance.</description>

      <description>Neural Networks Accelerator and Applications   Neural networks (NNs) have been successfully implemented in modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications ranging from image processing to speech recognition to natural language processing. While NNs deliver superior accuracy, they still suffer from the high cost of computational complexity and a significant amount of data movement. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most representative class of NNs, which have been widely applied to image classification.</description>
