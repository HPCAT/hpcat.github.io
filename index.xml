      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Emerging Interconnects Technologies for Network-on-Chips   There is a shift from multi-core to many-core architectures containing hundreds to a thousand cores on a single chip. However, traditional on-chip metallic interconnects require excessive power as technology keeps scaling and will not be able to provide communication support for manycore architectures. Moreover, fundamental signaling limitations (reflections, crosstalk), electromagnetic interference (EMI), clock skew, and other problems associated with metallic interconnects will only exacerbate the power dissipation problem and thereby limit the performance of future manycore processors.</description>

      <description>Accelerator-rich Heterogeneous Architectures   In the dark silicon era, only a fraction of transistors on a chip can be switched simultaneously due to constrained power budget. To improve energy-efficiency, general-purpose cores are augmented with specialized hardware or accelerators. These accelerators, which are optimized for specific applications (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits), can improve energy efficiency per operation by orders of magnitude over software running on general-purpose cores. The integration of general-purpose cores with accelerators on the same chip in a heterogeneous design environment, places several challenges on the NoC design.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning for High Performance, Energy-Efficient and Reliable NoCs   With continued aggressive technology scaling, Network-on- Chips (NoCs) architectures are facing three major challenges including minimizing power consumption, scaling performance and providing a reliable and robust communication limited by area, power, and cost constraints. Researchers have proposed various techniques individually tackling these challenges, while few efforts to date have simultaneously targeted improving power, performance and reliability together. Due to the complexity of the interactions among three competing objectives and explosion of design space, it is harder to manually design rules and strategies for interconnection system for optimizing power, reliability and performance.</description>

      <description>Energy-Efficient Scalable Multicore Architectures   Over the last decade, Moore’s Law has slowed, while Dennard Scaling has ended. The end of voltage scaling has made power dissipation the fundamental barrier to scaling computing performance across all platforms –from hand-held, embedded systems, to laptops, to servers, to datacenters. This challenge, often called the power wall, is seen across the board. To meet power challenges, recent research has proposed various low-power techniques.</description>

      <description>Approximate Communication   Recent research has shown that on-chip data movement consumes much more power than computation and this trend will continue in the future. Additionally, some algorithms and applications, such as machine learning, big data analysis, image/video processing and computer vision are tolerant to modest errors. These applications are inherently tolerant to some error in their output whether due to noisy input data, multiple correct answers or not requiring very accurate execution.</description>

      <description>Neural Networks Accelerator and Applications   Neural networks (NNs) have been successfully implemented in modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications ranging from image processing to speech recognition to natural language processing. While NNs deliver superior accuracy, they still suffer from the high cost of computational complexity and a significant amount of data movement. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most representative class of NNs, which have been widely applied to image classification.</description>
