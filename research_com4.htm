    <td><p class="style34">Symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) are attractive parallel computers widely used, since they provide a global physical address space and a symmetric access to the entire memory with increased flexibility and programmability. SMPs use fast snooping protocols to maintain cache coherence by broadcasting every request on the shared bus connecting all modules. Contention to acquire the bus in addition to faster processing capabilities of current processors degrades the performance of the shared bus. As the bus speed increases, the processor boards connected to the bus behave as stubs resulting in reflections of bus signals. Other fundamental problems such as impedance mismatch, stray capacitance, D I noise and crosstalk significantly affect the speed improvements of the shared bus. Therefore, the bus speed and the coherence overhead limit the rate at which address requests can be broadcast to all the processors/memory modules. This address rate/bandwidth is the main scaling limit, which cannot follow the increasing demands of faster and large number of processors, limiting the scalability of shared-bus based SMPs.</p>      </td>

    <td height="20"><p class="style34">One technology that can provide high communication bandwidth, low latency and scalability is optical interconnection technology. The recent advances in optical interconnect devices and packaging techniques such as multi-dimensional arrays of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), arrays of photodetectors (PDs) and waveguide optics are making optical interconnects a serious and potentially viable interconnect technology for parallel computing. Optical pulses can co-exist on the same optical line without interference if they are sufficiently separated. Even though requests can be pipelined by electrical interconnects, the rate at which requests from successive processors can be pipelined using optical technology is much greater and can be achieved without using any expensive multiplexer/demultiplexer circuits. In addition, the delay on optical signal or clock paths (fibers or waveguides) is not strongly dependent on temperature as in the case of electronics, and signal or clock edges do not degrade substantially over the scale of a computer room. It is likely possible to retain absolute timing accuracy in the delivery of optical signals of 10-100 ps over several meters. Moreover, optical interconnect based systems are easily scalable either by adding extra wavelengths or fiber channels in order to incorporate additional processors.</p>        
    <p class="style34">This project proposes an integrated solution to solve the address bandwidth requirements of large, scalable SMPs and still use fast snooping protocols to maintain cache coherence with low-latency using optical technology. An address sub-network, called Optical Symmetric Multiprocessor Network (SYMNET) using parallel optical interconnects is proposed with one-to-many communications. Parallel optical interconnects provide higher-bandwidth density product as compared to serial interconnects which provide higher bandwidth product. SYMNET, not only uses passive optical interconnects that increases the speed of the proposed network, but also pipelines address requests at a much faster rate than electronics. By using passive optical technology as opposed to more complex optical switching networks, the optical signal transfer in SYMNET is much faster since there is no optical switching or conversion. This results in increasing the address bandwidth for snooping and provides the impetus to develop scalable SMPs with hundreds of processors using optical interconnects, while using snooping cache coherence schemes. However, the preservation of cache coherence can no longer be maintained with the usual snooping protocols. We have introduced a modified snooping coherence protocol, called Coherence in SYMNET (COSYM) and verified its correctness using several transient states. SYMNET using the COSYM protocol is compared against electrical bus based systems using the MOESI protocol with Splash-2 benchmarks. </p></td>
