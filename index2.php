				<p>
					Dr. Ahmed Louri received the M.S and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles in 1984 and 1988 respectively. He joined the University of Arizona in 1988 where he is currently a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Director of the High Performance Computing Architectures and Technologies Laboratory. Dr. Louri chaired the Computer Engineering Program of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department from 2000 to 2006.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					From 2010 to 2013, he served as a Program Director in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) of the National Science Foundation with an annual research portfolio of $800 million. He managed the core computer architecture program and was on the management team of several cross-cutting programs including cyber-physical systems (CPS), Expeditions in Computing (EIC), Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI), Trustworthy Computing (SaTC), and Failure-Resistant Systems (FRS).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					He previously held visiting scientist positions at the Communications Research Laboratory (Tokyo, Japan), Laboratoire d'Informatique du Parallelism (LIP) (Lyon France), University of Tsukuba (Tsukuba, Japan), Universite de Paul Sabatier (Toulouse, France), and the National Center for Scientific Research (Centre Nationale de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)) Toulouse, France.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				 	His primary research interests include computer architecture, parallel and distributed  computing, interconnection networks, optical interconnects for parallel computing systems, reconfigurable computing systems, scalable and power-efficient architectures, fault-tolerant multiprocessors, Network on chips (NoCs) for multi-core and many-core architectures, fault-tolerant and self-healing NoCs, emerging interconnect technologies (photonic, wireless, RF, hybrid) for multi-core architectures and Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs), embedded and SoC systems. He has published more than 125 journal articles and conference papers in these areas, and holds several US patents. His research has been sponsored by NSF, DOE, AFOSR, and a number of industrial organizations.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Dr. Louri is the recipient of the National Science Foundation Research Initiation Award (1989), the Best article Award from IEEE Micro, the Advanced Telecommunications Organization of Japan Fellowship, the Centre Nationale de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), France, Fellowship, and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowship, and several teaching awards. Dr. Louri was instrumental in bringing optical interconnects into mainstream research in interconnection networks and bridging the gap between computer architecture and optics research communities. He served as a General Chair for the 13th Annual Symposium of the High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA-13), Phoenix, Arizona, 2007, the general Co-Chair of the Second Workshop on Optics in Communications and Computer Sciences (WOCCS-99), Toulouse France, 1999, and the General Chair for the Workshop on Optics in High-Performance Computing Systems, Lyon France 1996. He has served as a technical committee member for numerous international conferences including, Optical Society of America, meetings on Optics in Computing, the IEEE/OSA conference on Massively Parallel Processing using Optical Interconnects (MPPOI), the International conference on Parallel and Distributed computing and Systems (PDCS), the International Conference on Computing and Information (ICCI), the International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP), the International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), the ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communication Systems (ANCS), the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (IEEE Micro - 2012), the International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT-2013),  the ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (NOCS, 2012, 2013). He has served as guest editor for Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (JPDC, 2010-2011) and is currently serving as an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Computers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Dr. Louri is a Fellow of IEEE, a regular member of OSA, member of the International Society for Optical Engineering working Group on Optical Computing, member of the IEEE Society Technical Committee on Computer Architecture and member of the IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing.
