	<h2>Welcome to the HPCAT Lab!</h2>
	
	<p>
	Students in the HPCAT Lab work on designing, developing and validating
	novel power-efficient, performance-adaptive, fault-tolerant and
	self-healing networks for High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems and
	multicore architectures.
	</p>
	<p>
	Students gain a well-rounded experience in computer and communication
	systems design through solid theoritical studies, modeling and simulation
	experiments, performance evaluation and physical implementation. A variety
	of modeling and simulation tools as well as equipments are available for
	use in the Lab (see the Tools link).

	<h2><u>Postdoctoral Position:</u></h2>
	
	<p>
	A postdoctoral position is available at the High Performance Computer
	Architecture and Technologies (HPCAT) Lab at the Department of Electrical
	and Computer Engineering, The George Washington University, Washington DC.
	</p>
	<p>
	The appointee's research focus for this position is on the development and
	design of scalable, power-efficient and reliable netwrok-on-chip (NOC) for
	multi-core architectures with particular focus on analysis of
	power-performance trade-offs, design of fault-tolerant NoCs, and
	utilization of emerging technologies (e.g. optical interconnects, wireless,
	3D).
	</p>
	<p>
	The candidate will also help with the development of proposals, reports,
	and publishing research.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Desired Background:</h2>
	
	<p>
	Applicants should have earned a PhD degree in Electrical Engineering,
	Computer Engineering or Computer Science. Experience and publications in
	leading conferences and journals on computer architecture, scalable NoCs
	design (power-efficient, reliable, high-performance, interconnect
	technologies), and multi-core architectures is required.
	</p>

	<h2>About the University:</h2>
	
	<p>
	Founded in 1821, GW is the largest institution of higher education in the
	District of Columbia, to include ten academic units, with a full-time
	equivalent enrollment of a little over 20,000 students and approximately
	11,000 full-time and part-time employees (faculty and staff). The George
	Washington University is a community dedicated to learning,
	communication,respect, service and teamwork. As one of the largest private
	employers in the District of Columbia, the university seeks employees who
	support the teaching, research, and public service mission of the
	university.
