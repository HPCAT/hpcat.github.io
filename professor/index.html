<h1 id="ahmed-louri">Ahmed Louri</h1>

<p><img style="float: right;" src="/img/louri.jpg">
Dr. Ahmed Louri is the David and Marilyn Karlgaard Endowed Chair Professor of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at The George Washington University , which he joined in August 2015. He is also the Director of the High performance Computing Architectures and Technologies Laboratory. He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles in 1988. From 1988 to 2015, he was a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Arizona, and during that time, he served six years (2000 to 2006) as the Chair of the Computer Engineering Program. Throughout his career, Dr. Louri has held invited visiting scientist positions at various institutions, including the University of Electro-Communications (Chofu, Japan), the Communications Research Laboratory (Tokyo, Japan), the Laboratoire d&rsquo;Informatique du Parallelism (Lyon, France), the University of Tsukuba (Tsukuba, Japan), the Universite de Paul Sabatier (Toulouse, France), and the Centre Nationale de Recherche Scientifique (Toulouse, France). More</p>

<p>From 2010 to 2013, Dr. Louri served as a Program Director in the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science and Engineering (CISE) at the National Science Foundation (NSF) where he managed the core computer architecture program and was on the management team of several cross-cutting programs, including: cyber-physical systems (CPS); Expeditions in Computing (EIC); Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI); Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC); Failure-Resistant Systems (FRS), Science Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES); and Cyber-Discovery Initiative (CDI), among others. While at NSF, Dr. Louri initiated multidisciplinary research programs in several key areas of computer architecture, high-performance computing, sustainability, emerging technologies, resiliency, and security. He played a critical role in the creation of the XPS (eXploiting Parallelism and Scalability) program which is now in its fourth year (under the new name SPX, Scalable Parallelism in the Extreme). The XPS/SPX program aims to support groundbreaking research leading to a new era of parallel computing. This initiative has provided more than $100 million of funding for the research community thus far. At NSF, Dr. Louri also served on a number of NSF-wide task forces and working groups, including Sustainability, Optics &amp; Photonics, High-Performance Computing, Broadening Participation working groups, and the CISE Strategic Planning Committee.</p>

<p>Dr. Louri conducts research in the broad area of computer architecture and parallel computing with particular emphasis on interconnection networks, optical interconnects for parallel computing systems, reconfigurable computing systems, scalable and power-efficient architectures, Network on Chips (NoCs) for multi-core &amp; many-core architectures, fault-tolerant &amp; self-healing NoCs, emerging interconnect technologies (photonic, wireless, RF, hybrid) for multi-core architectures and Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs), embedded systems, and machine-learning enabled computing &amp; networking. He has published more than 160 refereed journal articles and peer-reviewed conference papers in these areas, and holds several US and international patents. His research has been sponsored by NSF, Department of Energy (DOE), Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), and a number of industrial organizations including Intel, IBM, Cisco, Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), Raytheon, Physical Optics Corporation, and US West Technologies.</p>

<p>Dr. Louri is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a member of the IEEE Society Technical Committee on Computer Architecture, a member of the IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing, and a member of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Microprocessors and Microcomputers. Dr. Louri is the recipient of the National Science Foundation Research Initiation Award (now called the NSF CAREER Award), the Best Article Award from the IEEE Micro, the Advanced Telecommunications Organization of Japan Fellowship, the Centre Nationale de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, France) Fellowship, and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Fellowship, as well as several teaching awards. His early work explored Optics&rsquo; unique properties to advance computing and communications. He was instrumental in bringing optical interconnects into mainstream research in computing and interconnection networks, and bridging the gap between computer architecture and optics research communities. He served as a general chair for the 13th Annual Symposium of the High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA-13, Phoenix Arizona, 2007); the general co-chair of the Second Workshop on Optics in Communications and Computer Sciences (WOCCS-99, Toulouse France, 1999); the general chair for the Workshop on Optics in High-Performance Computing Systems (Lyon France, 1996).</p>

<p>Dr. Louri currently serves as Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Emerging Technologies for Computing (TETC, 2015-present), and the IEEE Transaction on Sustainable Computing (T-SUSC, 2016-present). Since Jan. 2016, he has been serving on the Steering Committee for the IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing. Previously, he served as Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC, 2012-2017), a member of the editorial board of Cluster Computing ( the Journal of Networks, Software Tools and Applications, 2000-2010), and as a Special Issue Editor for the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (2010). He served as an evaluator on the IEEE Computer Society Fellow Evaluation Committee for 2011-2012, and as a Vice-Chair for the IEEE Fellow Evaluation Committee for 2013-2014, and he is currently the Vice-Chair for the IEEE Computer Society Fellow Evaluation Committee (2016-2017).</p>

<p>He has served and continues to serve on the executive and technical program committees of numerous international conferences including: The Optical Society of America, meetings on Optics in Computing, the IEEE/OSA conference on Massively Parallel Processing using Optical Interconnects (MPPOI), the IEEE Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA), the International Parallel &amp; Distributed processing Symposium (IPDPS), the International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing &amp; Systems (PDCS), the International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP), the ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking &amp; Communication Systems (ANCS), the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (IEEE Micro), the International Conference on Parallel Architectures &amp; Compilation Techniques (PACT), the ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chips (NOCS), the IEEE Hot Interconnects (HOTi), and the IEEE International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSoC), among others. He has served on the panels of several funding agencies and is often invited to be the Keynote Speaker at various conferences.</p>
