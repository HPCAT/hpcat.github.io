      <p class="style31">Market demands and the explosive growth in
internet and intranet applications coupled with the ever-increasing
demands for higher performance and sustained productivity in many
scientific applications are accelerating the need for high-performance
scalable parallel computing systems. One of the fundamental problems in
high-performance scalable computers is the ever-increasing speed of the
processors themselves and the growing performance gap between processor
and the interconnect technologies. Today's readily available
microprocessors are running at over 2 Ghz, are capable of issuing many
instructions per cycle, and are able to tolerate large memory access
latencies using techniques such as lock-free caches, prefetching and
multithreading. However, these successful and efficient
latency-tolerating techniques require much more bandwidth and create
much more memory traffic by fetching more data than is needed.
Moreover, Moore 's Law states that microprocessor speed doubles every
18 months or so that will require corresponding increase in bandwidth
requirements. As data communication performance increases far more
slowly, bandwidth (both memory and communication) will be a major and
critical resource in the future. It is necessary that these short-range
communication networks must be built on scalable architectures for
systems to operate at maximum speed. </p>
      <p class="style31">In this project, we propose to investigate the
development and design of high bandwidth, low latency, optical
communication networks that will enable parallel computing systems to
be size and generation scalable. The approach combines the high
bandwidth, high connectivity, and design flexibility communication
advantages of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), fiber, and
waveguide interconnects with architectural innovations to greatly
reduce latency while providing high bandwidth and lower costs.</p>

      <p class="style31"> The dramatic scaling and improvements in complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, coupled with innovations in computer architecture, have created an information technology society and a national economy very much dependent on a steady exponential growth in computing power. Near-term projections call for high-performance computing (HPC) systems with computing power in the hundreds of Teraflops, and aggregate communication bandwidth around 40 Terabits per second (Tbps). For these systems to be scalable and reach the needed performance, the interconnection network connecting the processors, must itself be scalable in both size and bandwidth. The interconnection network must not only deliver communication bandwidth and cost that grow linearly with the increase in the number of processors, but must also maintain a low overall latency. However, as feature sizes decrease to the sub-micron regime, and clock rates increase to the multi-GHz range, electrical interconnects are predicted to reach their fundamental limits and become the ultimate bottleneck for performance due to skin effect, crosstalk, interference, dielectric imperfections, attenuation, clock skew, and high power requirements. The major bottleneck is the limited bandwidth at higher bit rates and longer communication distances. This limitation, if not dealt with, will create major bandwidth imbalances in future HPCs, and will significantly affect their performance and scalability. It is widely accepted that performance improvements for HPC systems will require the introduction of new interconnect technologies to be integrated with CMOS processor design into new balanced architectures. One of the technologies that has been recognized to have the potential to solve communication problems of HPC systems is optical interconnects. Optical interconnects could lead to wiring design simplification, reduction in power requirements, ample communication bandwidth, and lower communication latency. 
      </p>
      <p class="style31"> This research explores the application of optical technology to the communication problems of future HPC systems. The goal is to develop flexible and dynamically reconfigurable optical interconnection architectures that will scale to a large number of processors while delivering scalable bandwidth, low communication latency, low power consumption, and low cost. Reconfigurability will be realized by monitoring communication traffic intensities, and dynamically re-allocating bandwidth to adapt to changes in traffic patterns. The proposed architectures will also provide dynamic power management in order to optimize power consumption and lower communication costs. The proposed approach is an organized effort combining architecture, technology, simulation and physical demonstration. To achieve our goal, we propose a methodology that will: (1) provide ample communication bandwidth by exploiting key properties of optical technology, namely wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), and spatial division multiplexing (SDM), combining them into a Multi-WDM (M-WDM) technique and its extension to a Parallel-Multiple WDM (PM-WDM) scheme, (2) rely on power-efficient optical components and switches, thereby reducing power dissipation, minimizing cost and speeding up communication, and (3) exploit dynamic bandwidth re-allocation and power management techniques to provide full reconfigurability and optimized performance. The proposed research consists of three  inter-related tasks : <br>
(1) Development and design of reconfigurable and scalable optical interconnection architectures for HPCs, <br>
(2) Identification and characterization of possible optical components necessary for the implementation of the proposed architectures and their integration with current HPC systems, <br>
(3) Development of analytic modeling and simulation tools for the precise physical modeling of the optical implementation techniques, as well as end-to-end system modeling of the proposed architectures.
