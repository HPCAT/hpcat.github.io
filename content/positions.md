# Welcome to the HPCAT Lab!

Students in the HPCAT Lab work on designing, developing and validating novel power-efficient, performance-adaptive, fault-tolerant and self-healing networks for High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems and multicore architectures. Students gain a well-rounded experience in computer and communication systems design through solid theoritical studies, modeling and simulation experiments, performance evaluation and physical implementation. A variety of modeling and simulation tools as well as equipments are available for use in the Lab (see the Tools link).

## Positions Available:

### Postdoctoral Position:

A postdoctoral position is available at the High Performance Computer Architecture and Technologies (HPCAT) Lab at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The George Washington University, Washington DC (http://hpcat.seas.gwu.edu/). The appointee's research focus for this position is on the development and design of scalable, power-efficient and reliable Network-on-Chips (NOCs) for multi-core architectures.

#### Desired Background:

Applicants should have earned a PhD degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering or Computer Science. Experience and publications in leading conferences and journals on computer architecture, scalable NoCs design (power-efficient, reliable, high-performance, interconnect technologies), and multi-core architectures is required. The successful candidate will join a dedicated research team composed of about five Doctoral students and three MS students.

### Graduate Research Assistantships:

A Graduate Research Assistantship (GRAs) are available for Ph.D. students to work on a several federally funded research projects.

Students in the HPCAT Lab will work on designing, developing and validating novel power-efficient, performance-adaptive, fault-tolerant and self-healing network on chips (NoCs) for multicore architectures, and high-performance computing systems in general.

Students will gain a well-rounded experience in computer and communication systems design through solid theoretical studies, modeling and simulation experiments, performance evaluation and physical implementation. A variety of modeling and simulation tools as well as equipment are available for use in the Lab. Stills that are highly sought after in industry and research institutions.

Knowledge of basic computer architecture and programming skills are a plus. Successful candidates should be motivated and willing to learn new concepts and be at the forefront of cutting-edge-research in this exciting field.

## About the University:

The George Washington University, Founded in 1821, is the largest institution of higher education in the District of Columbia, to include ten academic units, with a full-time equivalent enrollment of a little over 20,000 students and approximately 11,000 full-time and part-time employees (faculty and staff). The university is located in the nation's capital, with close access to federal funding agencies, government research laboratories, and many relevant industrial companies. HPCAT is located in the Science and Engineering Hall (SEH). More information about SEH is available at http://seh.gwu.edu
