# Welcome to the HPCAT Lab!

Students in the HPCAT Lab work on designing, developing and validating novel power-efficient, performance-adaptive, fault-tolerant and self-healing networks for High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems and multicore architectures. Students gain a well-rounded experience in computer and communication systems design through solid theoritical studies, modeling and simulation experiments, performance evaluation and physical implementation. A variety of modeling and simulation tools as well as equipments are available for use in the Lab.
